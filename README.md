# Twitter+Extras 0.0.1

The fine folks at Twitter didn't update their Mac app in ages, they bought Tweetdeck and redesigned the Twitter experience, so I don't know how long it will take before the app gets scewed.

So I decided to add new features myself, using SIMBL. That's my first SIMBL experiment so be gentle :D Right now everything is just an hack put toghether in 3 days during spare time.

#Features

Added features right now:

- Mute filters

Next on the list:

- Tweet Marker
