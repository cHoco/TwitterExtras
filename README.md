# Twitter+Extras 0.0.2

The fine folks at Twitter didn't update their Mac app in ages, they bought Tweetdeck and redesigned the Twitter experience, so I don't know how long it will take before the app gets scewed.

So I decided to add new features myself, using SIMBL. That's my first SIMBL experiment so be gentle :D Right now everything is just an hack put toghether in 3 days during spare time.

#Features

Added features right now:

- Mute filters (Right now you need to restart the client if you want them to be applied to your existing tweets)
- Tweet Marker (Only initial support, right now you can set the last read tweet, both in the main timeline and in the mentions, by right clicking on and selecting the proper option)

**Important:
To enjoy all features download a binary copy of the pluging, don't compile yourself, because I can't include in the code the TweetMarker api-key**

Next on the list:

- Better TweetMarker support (loading from last tweet, visual feedback both when getting and setting the tweet)
- Instapaper/ReadItLeater/Readability
